# Smart Service Platform - Architecture Diagram

## Component Details

### Platform Core
- **Plugin Manager**: Central system for plugin lifecycle management
- **Security Validator**: Ensures plugin security compliance
- **Version Handler**: Manages plugin versions and updates
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate plugins
- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Database Manager**: Manages database isolation and connections

### Service Plugins
Each plugin operates independently with:
- Isolated database
- Dedicated API endpoints
- Custom business logic
- Specific UI components
- Service-specific features

### Access Control
1. **Platform Owner**
   - Full system access
   - Plugin management
   - Business verification
   - Security monitoring

2. **Business Owner**
   - Service-specific access
   - Limited to verified services
   - Employee management
   - Business operations

3. **Employees**
   - Task-specific access
   - Limited functionality
   - Managed by business owner

        L3 --> L4[API Security]
    end

        S2 --> S3[Data Encryption]
        S3 --> S4[Audit Logging]
    end
```

### Database Architecture
```mermaid

        PluginRegistry
    end

    subgraph "Plugin DBs"
        CarpetDB[Carpet Service DB]
        WeddingDB[Wedding Service DB]
        BarDB[Bar Service DB]
    end

    Users --> |References| CarpetDB
    Users --> |References| WeddingDB
    Users --> |References| BarDB
```

## Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant PM as Plugin Manager
    participant P as Plugin
    participant DB as Database

    C->>AG: Request
    AG->>PM: Validate Request
    PM->>P: Route to Plugin
    P->>DB: Database Operation
    DB-->>P: Response
    P-->>AG: Plugin Response
    AG-->>C: Final Response
```

## Plugin Installation Flow

```mermaid

    [*] --> Submitted
    Submitted --> Validating
    Validating --> SecurityCheck
    SecurityCheck --> DatabaseSetup
    DatabaseSetup --> PermissionSetup
    PermissionSetup --> Active
    Active --> [*]

    SecurityCheck --> Failed
    Failed --> [*]
```

This architecture ensures:
- Secure multi-tenancy
- Plugin isolation
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Business separation
- Data protection
